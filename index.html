					    Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become the <em>de facto</em> solution to drive human
					    progress and more specifically, automation. In the last few years, the worldâ€™s economy has been gravitating towards the AI/ML
					    domain (from industrial and scientific perspectives) and the expectation of growth has only been increasing with the rapid rate of 
					    innovation and commercial deployments.
				    </p>
					<p>
					   Over the past 7 editions, the CogArch workshop has brought together experts and knowledge on the most novel design ideas for cognitive systems. 
					   This workshop capitalizes on the synergy between industrial and academic efforts in order to provide a better understanding of cognitive systems 
					   and key concepts of their design. In particular, while previous editions of the workshop have attempted to address co-designed hardware-software 
					   architectures that enable the latest advancements in machine learning, this edition focuses on applying state-of-the-art machine learning models 
					   towards realizing novel processor architectures and design. Architecting, designing, verifying and manufacturing commercial-grade processor requires 
					   hundreds of highly skilled designers, complex toolflows and a time-to-market of several months to years, and leveraging AI techniques at various 
					   stages in the design cycle can serve to significantly ease these constraints.
				    </p>
					<p> 
					The CogArch workshop has already had seven successful editions, bringing together experts and knowledge on the most novel
					design ideas for cognitive systems. This workshop capitalizes on the synergy between industrial and academic efforts in order to provide
					a better understanding of cognitive systems and key enablers of their design.

					While accurate simulators are essential tools for
					architecture research, design, and development, their practicality is limited
					by an extremely long time-to-solution for realistic architectures and
					applications. The presentation will focus on recent advances aiming at
					developing AI techniques for architecture modeling and simulation (ModSim).  We
					will discuss research aiming at developing machine learning AI/ML techniques
					for architecture simulation with a spectrum of goals from accelerating to using
					AI/ML as an alternative to existing techniques . We will strive to answer key
					questions such as: Is it doable? Is it practical? Is it fast? Is it accurate?
					What is the range of uses? The ability of these methods to cope with
					heterogeneous architectures for complex workflows, and a new frontier of
					applicability to codesign of complex systems in a dynamic regime will be
					discussed.

						The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in an era of unprecedented computational demands, necessitating continuous
						innovation in computing systems. In this talk, we will highlight how codesign has been a key paradigm in enabling innovative solutions and
						state-of-the-art performance in Google's AI computing systems, namely Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). We present several codesign case studies
						across different layers of the stack, spanning hardware, systems, software, algorithms, all the way up to the datacenter. We discuss how TPUs
						have made judicious, yet opinionated bets in our design choices, and how these design choices have not only kept pace with the blistering rate
						of change, but also enabled many of the breakthroughs in AI.

						this trend continues to increase at an unforeseen rate. The large model size makes it impossible for their parameters to fit within a single accelerator
						device, whose memory is usually capped at tens of GBs. Furthermore, even if we succeed to fit the model into a single device, their tremendous compute
						requirement leads to almost impractical training time. For example, GPT-3 consists of 175B parameters and takes 355 GPU-years to train with a single
						NVIDIA V100 GPU. This has led to a growing interest in distributed training, which is the idea of sharding model weights and/or data samples across
						multiple accelerator devices. However, this comes at the expense of communication overhead to exchange gradients and activations, and it has already
						become a key bottleneck for distributed training. We identify that the communication challenge will get exacerbated in future systems that are expected
						to leverage multi-dimensional networks with heterogeneous bandwidths due to diverse fabric technologies (e.g., chiplets, rack-scale, and scaleout).
						We present our recent works on <em>(i)</em> modeling future training platforms to identify such bottlenecks, and <em>(ii)</em> a novel runtime scheduling
						policy to enhance network bandwidth utilization.

					<h3>End-to-End Learning with Fully Homomorphic Encryption in Memory</h3>
					<h4><a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/" target="_blank">Tajana Å imuniÄ‡ Rosing

					<p>
						The increasing amount of data and the growing complexity of problems has resulted in an ever-growing reliance on cloud computing.
						However, many applications, most notably in healthcare, finance or defense, demand security and privacy which today's solutions cannot
						fully address. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) elevates the bar of today's solutions by adding confidentiality of data during processing.
						It allows computation on fully encrypted data without the need for decryption, thus fully preserving privacy. To enable processing encrypted
						data at usable levels of classic security, e.g., 128-bit, the encryption procedure introduces noticeable data size expansion &mdash; the
						ciphertext is much bigger than the native aggregate of native data types. In this talk, we present MemFHE which is the first accelerator of
						both client and server for the latest Ring-GSW (Gentry, Sahai, and Waters) based homomorphic encryption schemes using Processing In Memory
						(PIM). PIM alleviates the data movement issues with large FHE encrypted data, while providing in-situ execution and extensive parallelism
						needed for FHEâ€™s polynomial operations. While the client-PIM can homomorphically encrypt and decrypt data, the server-PIM can process
						homomorphically encrypted data without decryption. Our server-PIM is pipelined and is designed to provide flexible bootstrapping, allowing
						two encryption techniques and various FHE security-levels based on the application requirements. We evaluate our design at various security-levels
						and compare it with state-of-the-art CPU implementations for Ring-GSW based FHE. Our system is up to 20k&times; (265&times;) faster than CPU (GPU)
						for FHE arithmetic operations and provides on average 2007&times; higher throughput than the state of the art while implementing learning algorithms
						with FHE.

						(Intel)</a></h4>
					<p>
						Enabling processing encrypted data elevates the bar of confidentiality in existing security solutions and opens the front to new applications.
						It preserves individuals' privacy and market competitiveness while sustaining societal and economic growth through data sharing, collaboration,
						and artificial intelligence. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a unique family of cryptographic methods to process encrypted data. HE applications
						can reduce the risk of third-party data leakage at the processing node while preserving both data ownership and lifecycle. However, the performance
						gap that even the most efficient HE schemes hinder enabling meaningful HE applications and adopting the technology. HE applications can be a million
						times slower than the corresponding unencrypted applications on existing hardware architectures. Other barriers to adoption include the lack of
						development tools to reduce non-recurring engineering costs to build HE applications and the lack of international standards.
						Innovation in hardware architecture is the first step in bridging the performance gap and setting directions to enable meaningful technology adoption.
						In this talk, I will share Intel's innovation from theory to algorithms down to hardware architecture to allow the adoption of processing encrypted
						data with HE. Jointly with Microsoft, our Standards & Industry Organization and academic partners, we develop novel HE platforms comprehensive of
						revolutionary hardware, software libraries, development tools, and applications to make HE technologies accessible, performant, and cost-effective.
						We build an ecosystem that can sustain the exponential growth of HE-based technologies.

					<h3>Codesigning the Next Generation of Intelligent Computing Systems</h3>
					<h4><a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/people/kevin-j-barker" target="_blank">Kevin Barker
						(Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)</a></h4>
					<p>
						Convergence is driving the emergence of tightly integrated scientific workflows that combine physical simulation, machine learning, and analytics.
						However, such workflows are not well-served by existing computing capabilities that separate HPC and AI/ML computing paradigms into distinct ecosystems.
						While co-processor accelerators such as GPUs have been successfully applied to both HPC and AI/ML workloads, software stacks, programming languages, and
						programming models are still largely incompatible. Additionally, many scientific machine learning workloads exhibit characteristics that hamper their 
						performance on GPU throughput-oriented architectures. In this talk, we discuss our vision of the codesign process, as well as ongoing efforts at Pacific
						Northwest National Laboratory in codesigning hardware and software stacks to support this notion of convergence and the next generation of scientific computing.
